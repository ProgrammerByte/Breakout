# Breakout

12/04/19: A version of breakout I made using LibGDX including multiple levels and multiple types of blocks (e.g. unbreakable blocks). So far there are only 3 levels however more can easily be added (by using the arrays) and I am planning on creating a level editor for the game.

Update 18/04/19: Added multiple menus as well as a level editor so you can make and play your own levels using all the blocks available in the game already. All contents are stored in a text file via run length encoding.

Update 22/04/19: Improved collision between ball and blocks (version 2.1).

Update 01/06/20: Added a runnable jar file in the "final" file.

Update 02/06/20: Minor bug fixes (related to non integer division and an empty list of levels). Due to how this project is so old, I have come to realise how inexperienced I was with OOP at the time, therefore the code is sometimes painful to trek through. As a result of this I believe this may be the last update to this project other than minor bug fixes.

Controls (not including level editor):                                                                                          
Left Click - Throw ball / proceed to next level                                                               
Move mouse - Move paddle                                                     
B / BACKSPACE - Return to main menu                                       
Toggle FullScreen - F
