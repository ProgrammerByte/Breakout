# Breakout
A version of breakout I made using LibGDX including multiple levels and multiple types of blocks (e.g. unbreakable blocks). So far there are only 2 levels however more can easily be added (by using the arrays) and I am planning on creating a level editor for the game.

Controls:                                                                                          
Left Click - Throw ball / proceed to next level                                                               
Move mouse - Move paddle                                                      
Q / END / Esc - Quit game
