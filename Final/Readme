This (should be) the final version of my Breakout project which I worked on during May 2019 (with some minor bug fixes in June 2020) using LibGDX. My program layout wasn't the best back then therefore making adjustments is rather difficult.  
  
This folder contains four files - only two of which are required for the game to work (Breakout.jar and Levels). The Breakout folder contains the source code of the game, therefore can be deleted if unwanted.
